\subsection{Applications}
Given the family of curves $u(x,y) = c_1$, the family of curves orthogonal to these are the solution to: \[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} dy = \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} dx
.\] 
\subsubsection{2nd-Order ODE}
\begin{definition}
	The general form of a 2nd order differential equation is: \[
		y'' = F(x,y,y')
	.\] Where $x$ is the independent variable and  $y$ is the dependent variable.
\end{definition}
We want to consider a few special cases. The first one is when the dependent variable is missing, $y''=f(x,y')$, for example  $y''=x-y'$. In this case, you can set  $v=y'$ $v'=y''$, giving us: \[
	v'=f(x,v)
\]  which is a first order equation. Thus we can solve the first order ODE and then integrate to get $y$.
\begin{example}
	Consider the earlier equation $y''=x-y'$, we have: \[
	v' = x-v \implies \frac{dv}{dx}+v = x
	\] \[
	v = e^{-x}((x-1)e^{x}+c_1) = x-1+c_1e^{-x} = \frac{dy}{dx}
	.\] \[
	y = \frac{1}{2}x^2+x+c_2e^{-x}+c_3
	.\] for some constants $c_2$ and $c_3$.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
	Note that for a first order ODE, there should be one arbitrary constant, but for second order, there should be 2.
\end{remark}
The second case is where the independent variable is missing, meaning: \[
	\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = F(y,\frac{dy}{dx}) \implies \frac{dv}{dx} = \frac{dv}{dy} \frac{dy}{dx} =  v \frac{dv}{dy} = F(y,v)
.\] Where $v$ is once again $\frac{dy}{dx}$. Using this, we can solve for $v$ in terms of $y$ and then integrate twice.
